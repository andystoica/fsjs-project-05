Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript
Project 5 - Movie Search App with the OMDb API
==============================================

In this project, you'll build a "Movie Search" app using the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API.

You'll need to use your knowledge of basic JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX including loading JSON data from a server using a GET HTTP request.

We'll give you basic HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript file to get you started. You'll need to program the search form to return movie data in JSON format based on the form submission. You'll use the API data to dynamically create HTML displaying a movie's title, year of release, and poster image.
